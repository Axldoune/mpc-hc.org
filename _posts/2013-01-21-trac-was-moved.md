.. title: Trac was moved to our own server
.. author: XhmikosR

.. abstract

After all these years, one of the most wanted things in our to-do list can be
finally crossed out!

.. body

    <p>
    SourceForge's Trac has served us for many years, approximately 5, but it had
    all kinds of issues; it was slow, unmaintainable, custom query was broken for
    at least 4 years now. We had reported all this to SourceForge, but they didn't
    do anything; especially after their "new" platform launch, all our hopes were lost.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'd like to thank <strong><a href="http://www.cloudvps.com/">CloudVPS</a></strong>
    for sponsoring us with a server, <strong>Armada</strong> for making the sponsors
    research and negotiations, and last, but definitely not least, <strong>JellyFrog</strong>
    for setting up the new Trac.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please read <strong><a href="https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/Reclaim_Account">this</a></strong>
    to learn how to reclaim your old Trac account on the new Trac.
    </p>
    <p>
    We'll see how things will go and if everything goes well we'll move the website
    too in the near future.
