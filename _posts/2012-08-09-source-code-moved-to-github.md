.. title: Source code moved to GitHub
.. author: XhmikosR

.. abstract

After a lot of discussion, all the people involved with the development decided
to move to [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and to [GitHub](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc) for hosting the source.

.. body

The SourceForge svn repository isn't updated anymore, but this might change
in the future and we might sync it.

Things are easier now for people who want to contribute.
Fork the repository, do your changes and then create
a [pull request](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc/pulls).
